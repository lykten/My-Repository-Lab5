## Description
Hi! I am Kiril, a student currently learning programming and version control systems.  
This repository is created for completing my Git & GitHub laboratory work and improving my Markdown formatting skills.
## My favorite university subjects
1. Mathematics   
2. Algorithmization and programming  
3. Artificial Intelligence   
4. Analytical geometry

## Online VS offline studying

| **Online studying** | **Offline studying** |
|:-----------------------:|:----------------------:|
| You can study from anywhere in the world  | Real communication with teachers and classmates |
| Flexible schedule and comfort of home  | Better focus and fewer distractions |
## My favorite math formulas

Here are some of my favorite math formulas:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$ 

,- this is the formula for the ratio of the sides of a right triangle according to the Pythagorean theorem.


$$
x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$  

,- this is a formula for finding the roots of quadratic equations using the discriminant.


$$
\cos^2\alpha + \cos^2\beta + \cos^2\gamma = 1
$$


,- this formula expresses the relation between the direction cosines (α, β, γ) of a vector in 3D space - their squares always sum up to 1.

## My coding skills

Here’s a simple C++ program that prints **Hello, GitHub!** 

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, GitHub!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
The `main()` function is the entry point of the program - it starts execution, prints the message to the console, and then ends successfully.

You can test this code online here: Run in [CPP Shell](https://cpp.sh/?source=%23include+%3Ciostream%3E%0D%0Ausing+namespace+std%3B%0D%0A%0D%0Aint+main()+%7B%0D%0A++++cout+%3C%3C+%22Hello%2C+GitHub!%22+%3C%3C+endl%3B%0D%0A++++return+0%3B%0D%0A%7D)

## The image I like
I like this picture because it shows a quiet foggy street at night.  
The soft light from the lamps, the mist, and the calm atmosphere create a feeling of peace and mystery.
